# Introduction

It's been quite some time since my last post on my personal website, but I recently dedicated a weekend to revamping it.
Here's a brief summary of the changes I made:

* Migration from [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) to [Astro](https://astro.build), a web framework similar to Next.js.
* Introduction of reaction buttons at the end of each blog post.

The transition from Hugo to Astro went smoothly, primarily because Astro provides excellent support for Markdown,
which I had been using for my blog. In this article, I'll share my experience with the transition process and delve
into the steps I took to implement the blog reaction buttons.

# The Blog Framework -- Astro

When deciding on a framework for my new personal website, Astro stood out for two primary reasons. Firstly, I wanted
to explore a full-stack web application framework in JavaScript / TypeScript, and Astro provided the perfect opportunity
to do so. Secondly, Astro's blog template offered easy customization options and comprehensive RSS support, which was
crucial for my blogging needs.

<small>Fun fact: A hidden facet of my expertise that often goes unnoticed -- I have been involved in web development for 9 years since my initial PHP project in 2014, apart from my more recent Rust + database background. The PHP project was a Codeforces-style online judge for internal use.</small>

## Project Setup

I started my project using the `npm create astro` command with the minimum blog template.

```bash
npm create astro@latest -- --template blog
```

After a 30-second setup wizard, I got the website running locally:

## Migrating Markdown Files and Assets

Thanks to Astro's native support for Markdown, transferring my previous blog content to the new blog was a breeze. I
simply had to copy and paste all the markdown files from my previous blog into the new Astro setup. However, there was
a slight issue. I was using TOML front-matters while Astro only supports YAML ones. I had to make some minor
modifications to the front-matter to make it work.

As for image assets, Astro offers a handy extension called [@astrojs/image](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/image/),
which automatically compresses and optimizes all images on the website. However, my website doesn't contain heavy image
assets, and I decided to take a different approach that I placed them directly into the public directory. This way, the
directory layout is structured as follows:

```
skyzh.dev
|-public
  |-blog
    |-2023-07-09-blog-update
      |-image.png
|-src
  |-content
    |-blog
      |-2023-07-09-blog-update.md
```

Additionally, Astro introduces a special format known as mdx, which combines the simplicity of Markdown with the
flexibility of JavaScript / TypeScript. This feature allows me to effortlessly embed dynamic content within my blog posts.
For example,

import Reaction from '../../components/Reaction.tsx';

<fieldset style={{ "border": "1px solid", "padding": "1em" }}>
  <legend>Reaction Testing</legend>
  <Reaction slug="test" client:load />
</fieldset>

```jsx
<fieldset style={{ "border": "1px solid", "padding": "1em" }}>
  <legend>Reaction Testing</legend>
  <Reaction slug="test" client:load />
</fieldset>
```

‚¨ÜÔ∏è Introducing the latest addition to my personal website‚Äîthe reactions feature! Now, you can express your feelings about
any of the blog posts by simply clicking the emoji button. Feel free to click it multiple times if you want to convey
varying levels of reaction. The entire process is completely anonymous. In the following section, I will provide a
detailed overview of how I implemented this new feature.

## Redirects

After completing the migration, I realized that the URLs for all my blog posts had changed. To ensure that users who
still access my website using the old URLs don't encounter 404 errors, I needed to set up redirects. Fortunately, Astro
offers a redirects configuration option in the `astro.config.mjs` file.

I wanted to redirect all requests from `/posts/articles/*` to `/blog/*`, but Astro's redirects feature doesn't support
wildcard redirects in static rendering mode. It requires server-side rendering support, which I didn't want to enable
for my website.

To overcome this limitation, I configured Astro to generate a redirect page for each of my blog posts at the old URL.
This way, when a user tries to access a blog post through the old URL, they will be automatically redirected to the
corresponding new URL. You can find the [[source code]](https://github.com/skyzh/skyzh-site/blob/main/src/pages/posts/articles/%5B...slug%5D.astro) for this redirect setup here.

# Reactions


One exciting feature I've been diligently working on for my new personal website is the integration of reactions within
my blog posts. Thanks to the powerful combination of Neon and Vercel, I can implement this functionality in a *serverless*
manner, eliminating the need to manage any databases on my own cloud server.

[Neon Postgres](https://neon.tech) offers a fully-managed Postgres service (which is the company I'm currently working for... ü§™).
Leveraging this service, I can seamlessly incorporate reactions into my blog without the hassle of setting up and
maintaining my own database infrastructure.

Furthermore, I have been using Vercel for deploying my website for the past 2 years. Now, with the introduction of
[Vercel Edge Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/edge-functions), I can set up APIs on my website
to retrieve and update reactions data. Both Neon and Vercel provide generous *FREE* tiers, enabling me to build and
implement this feature without paying a dollar.

## API Design, and Deploying to Vercel Edge Functions

I built two Vercel Edge Functions for the *Reactions* API:

```
GET /api/reactions/get?slug=2023-07-09-blog-update
POST /api/reactions/add
```

As the name suggests, the `get` API is used to get the reaction counts for a specific blog post, and the `add` API is
used to add a reaction to a specific blog post. The `slug` parameter is the unique identifier for each blog post.
[[source code]](https://github.com/skyzh/skyzh-site/tree/main/api/reactions)

## Neon Postgres and Serverless Driver

To store the reaction data for my blog posts, I opted to utilize Neon Postgres. Setting it up is super easy.
I simply created a new project and obtained the Postgres connection string directly from the Neon console.
The process takes only a matter of seconds.

![Neon Project Overview](neon.png)

Since Vercel Edge Functions operate on a lightweight JavaScript runtime, establishing a direct TCP connection to
Postgres isn't feasible. It only supports HTTP / WebSocket. Therefore, I incorporated the [Neon Serverless Driver](https://github.com/neondatabase/serverless)
to connect to Neon, which establishes a WebSocket connection to the Postgres WebSocket proxy hosted by Neon.

The Neon Serverless Driver acts as a drop-in replacement for the `pg` package, making it compatible with existing
Postgres libraries. For instance, I'm utilizing the `Kysely` library for constructing queries. Here's an example of the
code structure:

```typescript
import { Pool } from '@neondatabase/serverless';

// ...

const pool = new Pool({ connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL });
const db = new Kysely<DB>({ dialect: new PostgresDialect({ pool }) });


const query = db
  .selectFrom('reaction')
  .selectAll()
  .where('name', '=', slug)

const reactions = await query.executeTakeFirst();

// ...
```

The only difference between [server-side code on Vercel](https://github.com/skyzh/skyzh-site/blob/main/api/reactions/get.ts)
and [client-side code running locally](https://github.com/skyzh/skyzh-site/blob/main/scripts/populate_reaction.js) is that
the server-side code uses the `@neondatabase/serverless` package instead of `pg`. Therefore, it is easy to share code
between the serverless Edge Functions and the local scripts.

```javascript
import pg from 'pg';
const { Pool } = pg;

// Do the same thing as above...
```

## Populating Data

I designed the database schema to store reactions as follows:

```sql
CREATE TABLE reaction (
    slug varchar(255) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    emoji_1 INT DEFAULT 0,
    emoji_2 INT DEFAULT 0,
    emoji_3 INT DEFAULT 0,
    emoji_4 INT DEFAULT 0,
);
```

One blog post has exactly one row in the `reaction` table. Each column represents the number of reactions for a specific
emoji. The rows need to be pre-created before the website is deployed. I wrote a script to populate the data from the
list of existing blog posts in the `src/content/blog` directory. A JSON file containing all blog posts in the website
will be generated at [posts.json](https://github.com/skyzh/skyzh-site/blob/main/src/pages/posts.json.js) when the
website is built. The [populate reaction script](https://github.com/skyzh/skyzh-site/blob/main/scripts/populate_reaction.js)
will read this file and populate the data to the database. Users are only allowed to modify existing rows instead of adding new ones
through the Vercel Edge Function.

## Client-Side Rendering

Lastly, I need to render the reaction buttons on the client-side. This is done by React on the client (web browser side).
To enable client-side rendering support for Astro, I need to install the client-side rendering support:

```bash
npx astro add react
```

With React integrated, I was able to write client-side React code as I normally would. This included fetching the
reaction data from the API endpoint and updating it when users interacted with the reaction buttons. You can find the
source code for the reaction component [here](https://github.com/skyzh/skyzh-site/blob/main/src/components/Reaction.tsx).

The reaction component is used within the blog post layout, ensuring that it appears on every blog post page.
