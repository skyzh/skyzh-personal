I obtained my bachelor’s degree in computer science from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University][sjtu] and my master’s degree at [Carnegie Mellon University][cmu]. Currently, I work as a Systems Software Engineer at [Neon][neon].

I can be referred to as any combination of *Alex*, *Chi* and *Zhang*. For example, Alex Chi, Chi Zhang, Alex Chi Z., or Chi (Alex) Zhang.

I focused on building system software, especially database systems, during my undergraduate and graduate study. I built [AgateDB][agatedb] during my internship in PingCAP, worked on [TerarkDB][terarkdb] for Zoned Namespace SSDs at ByteDance, and participated in the early stage development of [RisingWave][risingwave] at RisingWave Labs (formerly known as Singularity Data). In summer 2023, I worked at [Neon][neon], which provides fully managed Postgres service.

I love becoming part of the open-source community. I’m currently the [TiKV project’s][tikv] maintainer. In addition, I maintain several widely-used projects like SJTUG mirror and SJTUThesis in the [SJTUG community][sjtug]. Furthermore, to enable more students to learn about database systems, I built an educational OLAP database called [RisingLight][risinglight] with my friends. The SQL layer of RisingLight was then ported to [BusTub](https://github.com/cmu-db/bustub), the course project for CMU 15-445/645 Database Systems, which made BusTub become a real SQL database system.

I'm interested in crafting educational materials in database systems. I have two tutorials on using the Rust programming language in data-intensive applications: [type-exercise-in-rust](https://github.com/skyzh/type-exercise-in-rust) is a tutorial for building a vectorized expression evaluation framework in database systems, and in [mini-lsm](https://github.com/skyzh/mini-lsm), you will learn how to build a LSM-tree storage engine. I worked as a teaching assistant for CMU-DB's BusTub database system for three semesters, during which I designed the SQL query frontend of the [query processing project](https://15445.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2022/project3/), as well as the [MVCC project](https://15445.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2023/project4/) based on HyPer. With my experience with the BusTub system, I wrote the [write-you-a-vector-db](https://github.com/skyzh/write-you-a-vector-db) tutorial where students can add vector capabilities to a relational database system.

For the future, I am constantly seeking opportunities to build things that excite me and impact people.
